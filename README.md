## Introduction
This repository is based on [sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning).

This model combines attention-based model proposed in [Show, Attend, and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) with language pretrained techniques, such as BERT, which wanna incorporate language knowledge into caption task.

## Requirements:

pytorch 1.3.1, python3.6, **nltk3.4.5**
